quantity Therefore this procedure can be used provided that standard arrangements are in place for clinical governance consent and audit Find out what standard arrangements mean on the NICE interventional procedures guidance page  The condition current treatments and procedure The condition  An anal fistula is an abnormal tract between the anal canal and the skin around the anus It may cause symptoms such as pain or discomfort and leak blood or pus It usually results from previous anal abscesses cryptoglandular and can be associated with other conditions including inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohns disease and cancer  Anal fistulas can be classified according to their relationship with the external sphincter A fistula may be complex with several openings onto the perianal skin Intersphincteric fistulas are the most common type and cross only the internal anal sphincter Trans-sphincteric fistulas pass through both the internal and external sphincters Current treatments  Treatment of an anal fistula commonly involves surgery The type of surgery depends on the medical history extent location and complexity of the fistula in relation to surrounding muscles The aim is to drain infected material and encourage healing If the fistula does not heal completely another surgical procedure may be needed For simple intersphincteric and low trans-sphincteric anal fistulas the most common treatment is a fistulotomy or laying open of the fistula tract involving muscle division that may affect continence For high and complex deeper fistulas that involve more muscle with a high risk of faecal incontinence or recurrence surgery aims to treat the fistula and preserve sphincter-muscle function Techniques include a -stage or -stage seton suture material or rubber sling either alone or in combination with fistulotomy ligation of an intersphincteric fistula tract creating a mucosal advancement flap injecting glue or paste or inserting a fistula plug in line with NICEs interventional procedures guidance on fistula plug The procedure  Endoscopic ablation of an anal fistula is a less invasive procedure than surgery It aims to preserve sphincter-muscle function and faecal continence It may be done in combination with surgical techniques such as creating a mucosal advancement flap  The procedure is usually done as a day case using spinal or general anaesthesia With the patient in the lithotomy position a fistuloscope is Endoscopic ablation for an anal fistula IPGinserted into the fistula tract from the external opening A continuous jet of irrigation solution is used which allows optimal visualisation of the fistula tract the internal opening and any secondary tracts or abscess cavities When the fistuloscope exits through the internal opening to the rectal mucosa  or  stitches are inserted to isolate the internal opening Under direct vision an electrode is passed through the fistuloscope and the material in the fistula tract is cauterised from the external to the internal opening All necrotic material is removed using a fistula brush and a continuous jet of irrigation solution The fistuloscope is removed and the internal opening closed by suturing stapling or by creating a cutaneous mucosal flap  Committee considerations The evidence  To inform the committee NICE did a rapid review of the published literature on the efficacy and safety of this procedure This comprised a comprehensive literature search and detailed review of the evidence from  sources which was discussed by the committee The evidence included  systematic reviews and  case series and is presented in table  of the interventional procedures overview Other relevant literature is in the appendix of the overview  The specialist advisers and the committee considered the key efficacy outcomes to be ablation of the fistula prevention of recurrence and the need for repeated surgery and improved quality of life  The specialist advisers and the committee considered the key safety outcomes to be bleeding and infection  Seven commentaries from patients who had experience of this procedure were received which were discussed by the committee Endoscopic ablation for an anal fistula IPGCommittee comments  The committee noted that the procedure needs specialised instrumentation and appropriate training  The committee was informed that this procedure allows the direct visualisation of the fistula tract to allow treatment planning and that this is important for the procedures success  The committee was informed that for patients with inflammatory bowel disease the aim of the procedure is often visualisation of the tract and reducing the inflammatory burden within a complex fistula tract system rather than definitive treatment ISBN ----
