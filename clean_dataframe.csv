59,spectra-optia-for-automatic-red-blood-cell-exchange-in-people-with-sickle-cell-disease-pdf-64371941564101.pdf,Recommend, The case for adopting Spectra Optia for automated red blood cell exchange in people with sickle cell disease who need regular transfusions is supported by the evidence Spectra Optia is faster to use and needs to be done less often than manual red blood cell exchange  NICE recommends collaborative data collection to generate further clinical evidence on some outcomes of treatment with Spectra Optia In particular there is a need for long-term data on how automated and manual exchange affect iron overload status and the subsequent need for chelation therapy  Based on current evidence and expert advice on the anticipated benefits of the technology when used in people with iron overload cost modelling shows that in most cases using Spectra Optia is cost saving compared with manual red blood cell exchange or top-up transfusion The savings depend on the iron overload status of the person being treated and are more likely to be achieved if devices already owned by the NHS can be used to treat sickle cell disease The estimated cost saving for adopting Spectra Optia is  per person per year which has the potential to save the NHS in England  million each year Spectra Optia for automatic red blood cell exchange in people with sickle cell diseaseMTG
62,the-geko-device-for-reducing-the-risk-of-venous-thromboembolism-pdf-64371882777541.pdf,Recommend, The case for adopting the geko device is supported for use in people who have a high risk of venous thromboembolism and for whom other mechanical and pharmacological methods of prophylaxis are impractical or contraindicated Although clinical evidence is limited the case is supported because of the plausibility that the geko device may reduce the high risk of venous thromboembolism in patients who cannot use other forms of prophylaxis and the low risk of the device causing harm  In patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism who would otherwise receive no prophylaxis using the geko device is estimated to be cost saving The amount saved depends on the level of reduction in relative risk of deep vein thrombosis associated with geko treatment compared with no treatment There is no direct evidence on the size of this reduction but when values obtained with other mechanical methods of prophylaxis were used in cost modelling the estimated cost saving for the geko device in patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism compared with no prophylaxis was  per patient The geko device for reducing the risk of venous thromboembolism MTG
35,the-plasma-system-for-transurethral-resection-and-haemostasis-of-the-prostate-pdf-64372114564549.pdf,Recommend, The evidence supports the case for adopting the PLASMA system for bipolar transurethral resection and haemostasis of the prostate Clinical outcomes are comparable with monopolar transurethral resection of the prostate mTURP but PLASMA avoids the risk of transurethral resection syndrome and reduces the need for blood transfusion and the length of hospital stay  The PLASMA system for prostate resection and haemostasis should be considered as an option for people with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia when surgical intervention is indicated  Cost modelling estimates that the PLASMA system is cost saving by  per procedure compared with mTURP for hospitals that already use an Olympus platform and  for those that do not This assumes a reduced -day length of stay with PLASMA and that  of procedures need a second electrode for haemostasis Evidence suggests there are reduced readmissions with the PLASMA system compared with mTURP This would increase cost saving to  for hospitals that already use an Olympus platform and  for those that do not 
15,thopaz-portable-digital-system-for-managing-chest-drains-pdf-64372000350661.pdf,Recommend, The case for adopting Thopaz for managing chest drains is supported by the evidence Thopaz can reduce drainage time and length of stay in hospital and improves safety for people with chest drains Its use may also improve clinical decision-making through continuous objective monitoring of air leaks and fluid loss  Thopaz should be considered for people who need chest drainage after pulmonary resection or because of a pneumothorax The system can increase patient mobility because it is portable Staff find it more convenient and easier to use than conventional chest drains  Cost modelling indicates that Thopaz is cost saving compared with conventional chest drains in people after pulmonary resection The estimated saving is  per patient per hospital stay with savings mainly achieved through reduced length of stay  The resource impact assessment for this guidance shows that at a national level adopting Thopaz is expected to save around  million per year in England Thopaz portable digital system for managing chest drains MTG

43,gammacore-for-cluster-headache-pdf-64372059137221.pdf,Recommend With Restrictions (Prerequisites), Evidence supports the case for adopting gammaCore to treat cluster headache in the NHS gammaCore reduces the frequency and intensity of cluster headache attacks and improves quality of life  gammaCore is not effective in everyone with cluster headache Treatment with gammaCore should only continue for people whose symptoms reduce in the first  months  Cost modelling estimates that in the first year of treatment adding gammaCore to standard care is cost saving compared with standard care alone by an average of  per person This cost saving  assumes that the first -month period of gammaCore use is offered by the company free of charge  largely results from less use of subcutaneous sumatriptan 
5,optilume-for-treating-recurrent-bulbar-urethral-strictures-pdf-64372235496901.pdf,Recommend With Restrictions (Prerequisites), Optilume is recommended as an option to treat recurrent bulbar urethral strictures in adults only if comparative data is collected on  patient-reported outcome measures  reintervention rates  Find out details of required outcomes in the section on further research 
14,peristeen-plus-transanal-irrigation-system-for-managing-bowel-dysfunction-pdf-64371998671045.pdf,Recommend With Restrictions (Prerequisites), The case for adopting Peristeen Plus for transanal irrigation in people with bowel dysfunction is supported by the evidence Peristeen Plus can reduce the severity of constipation and incontinence improve quality of life and promote dignity and independence  Peristeen Plus may not be suitable for all people with bowel dysfunction It may take several weeks before a person is comfortable with using Peristeen Plus and some people may choose to stop using it Peristeen Plus is therefore most effective when it is offered with specialist training for users carers and NHS staff and structured patient support  Cost modelling for Peristeen Plus is uncertain but it is likely that Peristeen Plus provides additional clinical benefits without costing more than standard bowel care  Peristeen Plus transanal irrigation system for managing bowel dysfunction MTG
52,senza-spinal-cord-stimulation-system-for-delivering-hf10-therapy-to-treat-chronic-neuropathic-pain-pdf-64372050739141.pdf,Recommend With Restrictions (Prerequisites), The case for adopting Senza spinal cord stimulation SCS for delivering HF therapy as a treatment option for chronic neuropathic back or leg pain after failed back surgery is supported by the evidence HF therapy using Senza SCS is at least as effective as low-frequency SCS in reducing pain and functional disability and avoids the experience of tingling sensations paraesthesia  Senza SCS for delivering HF therapy should be considered for patients  with residual chronic neuropathic back or leg pain at least  mm on a  mm to  mm visual analogue scale at least  months after back surgery despite conventional medical management and  who have had a successful trial of stimulation as part of a wider assessment by a multidisciplinary team  Patients with other causes of neuropathic pain were included in the evaluation and may be considered for HF therapy using Senza SCS but any additional benefits compared with low-frequency SCS are less certain Cost modelling indicates that over  years HF therapy using Senza SCS has similar costs to low-frequency SCS using either a rechargeable or non-rechargeable device  Clinicians implanting SCS devices including Senza should submit timely and complete data to the UK Neuromodulation Registry  When assessing the severity of pain and the trial of stimulation the multidisciplinary team should be aware of the need to ensure equality of access to treatment with SCS Tests to assess pain and response to SCS should take into account a persons disabilities such as physical or sensory disabilities or linguistic or other communication difficulties and may need to be adapted 
16,sleepio-to-treat-insomnia-and-insomnia-symptoms-pdf-64372230458053.pdf,Recommend With Restrictions (Prerequisites), Sleepio is recommended as a cost saving option for treating insomnia and insomnia symptoms in primary care for people who would otherwise be offered sleep hygiene or sleeping pills  For people who may be at higher risk of other sleep disorder conditions such as in pregnancy or in people with comorbidities a medical assessment should be done before referral to Sleepio  More research or data collection is recommended on Sleepio for people who are eligible for face-to-face cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia CBT-I in primary care This is because there is limited clinical evidence to show how effective Sleepio is compared with face-to-face CBT-I Find out more in the further research section 
34,the-vac-veraflo-therapy-system-for-acute-infected-or-chronic-wounds-that-are-failing-to-heal-pdf-64372116244165.pdf,Recommend With Restrictions (Prerequisites), The VAC Veraflo Therapy system shows promise for treating acute infected or chronic wounds that are not healing However there is not enough good-quality evidence to support the case for routine adoption  Research in the form of a randomised controlled trial is recommended to show clinically meaningful benefits for the VAC Veraflo Therapy system wound instillation with negative pressure therapy compared with negative pressure wound therapy alone A key outcome should be time to wound closure
